	A cold and starry night, the wind blew the snow across his face. All his mind did was race, it was his turn to chase. He threw the cigarette on the ground, and as the red cherry met its end against the pure white snow, Johnny knew what he had to do. He had to kill.

Killing wasn’t new to Johnny, but it had been a while. Ever since He started dating Jane... Beautiful Jane... Every time he thought of her he couldn’t help but smile. Even in the gravest of circumstances. And this was as grave as a six foot deep fucking ditch.

Johnny had no time to waste, he got up from the Poolside chair he had been sitting in for at least 30 minutes in the strongest blizzard in the past 5 years, and began to walk out of his back yard. He walked into his house, past his parents room, and into his own.. Into his closet, into the spot, he took out the key from his necklace, and opened up the box. The only thing that’s kept him sane for the past 3 years of living at home again with his parents. At 21 Johnny had gotten a DUI and never really recovered in terms of “dealing with the real world.” One day he was fist fighting with his friends from high school in the park, nothing serious, just until someone gave up, when all of a sudden some rich looking prick in a business suit came up to Johnny and went “You look like you have potential kid.”

“Potential” Johnny whispered as he took his property out of the box. Johnny was walking further away from his potential by the minute, And not just as far as a career with a nice looking house, a beautiful wife, 2 to 3 children, and a mistress on the side. The potential to still be able to breath, eat, sleep, fuck, and fucking think was around the block.

Johnny Wouldn’t even have a problem if Mr. Fantoni Hadn’t already tried to Kill Jane’s father a month ago. Johnny’s boss had not particularly taken to the idea of Johnny quitting the business for some girl. That wasn’t the reason He wanted her father dead though.

Johnny snuck up behind one of the 2 guards stationed in the back yard like a whisper, Johnny’s knife dragged across the saps throat and blood cried out. Johnny lost himself in the red, just for a minute. It had been a long time, and the slow pulse of the blood flow was mesmerizing. Once it began to peter off, Johnny set back to work. He picked a nice night for this, the snow muting his foot steps and the wind lowering visibility, which can be bad for both parties. This was like slipping on a glove for Johnny though. He had lost himself for a minute, but now he was awake. He could almost predict exactly every step the other guard was taking, Johnny thought that this must be how a cat feels when he knows he’s about to make his kill. The mouse squeeked as Johnny stabbed his claw into him, but the wind covered it up. No use hiding the bodies as them being missing would raise an alarm in any case.

Into the house now, the familiar scents, it’s strange for Johnny.. He sees himself happy here, it almost feels dirty to bring his work here. But this is the only way, if I don’t kill Jane’s father Mr. Fantoni said he’d kill Jane. Johnny thought to himself. Johnny Hated that fat fuck.

For 2 years, Jonny was like the son he never had, money for anything he needed or wanted. He threw parties for Johnny, he told Johnny how he wanted him to marry one of his daughters. “Johnny, I’m fuckin’ serious. Whichever one you want.” “No way dude, that’d be too weird... Havin’ you as like.. A dad.”

Johnny, having just choked out the guard in the kitchen, had cleared the first floor, with no problems, but he had to hurry, the first time someone called on the radio without a response.. “Stevens come in.” fuck “Stevens come in I haven’t heard from Gomez or Jansen in the back in 15 minutes.” Slow and steady had not won the race, all bets were now off. Johnny reached into his jacket, and took out his gun. He double checked the clip, put it back in, cocked the gun and started upstairs.

He thought briefly of the first time Jane had snuck him inside. Halfway up the stairs Johnny had pressed her against the wall and started kissing her. When their tongues touched it was like electricity, blue electricity dancing around in Johnny’s brain. He had never felt anything like it, and probably never would again. He had never felt a girl actually care about him before. Most girls didn’t even look him in the eyes when they had sex. And afterwords, not that Johnny was the type that needed to cuddle, but they wouldn’t even hold hands or anything. Jane was different. In every way. She shoved him onto the bed and straddled him, and as she slid him inside she stared directly into his eyes, and it felt good.

Johnny was crying when he peaked around the corner of the entranceway to the 2nd floor. And as he slowly crept up he felt the hot streaks down his cheeks. He had no time to wipe them because to his right at the end of the hall was Janes fathers room. Which meant 3 guards, plus Jane, her baby sister, and her mother and father were in that room. In front of the door were two guards, and to his left at the other end of the hall there were 2 more guards. You would think this would be considered overkill for a fucking Senator, they don’t even fucking do anything Johnny thought. Thankfully, only an idiot would attempt a politicians house without the proper equipment, and Johnny wasn’t an idiot. He took out the flash bangs he had ordered from the internet, and the super good ear plugs also from the internet, he placed the plugs gently in his ears and prepped the flashbangs.

Johnny threw one to the left and one to the right and covered his ears with his hands and tucked his head down into his lap. BAM! Johnny felt it in his stomach. He felt dizzy but he could stand. Slowly he looked around the corner to his left and right. He only saw smoke. He holstered his gun and took out his knife. He rounded tightly around the corner and cut through the smoke and heard their coughing. One guys ears were bleeding, the other guy was blinking a lot and looking up.. Johnny grabbed the first guy by the throat and plunged his knife into his upper abdomen and pushed up, killing the guy instantly. Johnny grabbed the other guard by the right arm and stabbed him through the hand, to wake him up a little. As the guard screamed Johnny holstered his knife, drew out his gun, and pulled the guard up in front of him while pulling the guards maimed hand behind him and steered him. Johnny stepped slowly forward through the clearing smoke, as the two guards on the other side Saw them approach they lifted their weapons and aimed them. “Drop your weapons or I’ll waste this sack of shit you fucks!” “Alright you psychopath!

Drop the weapon and we won’t sodomize you before we paralize you!” Johnny decided he should probably kill that guy first. With his right hand holding a gun against the guards head, he let go of the mangled hand and reached behind his back with his left hand, and drew the shotgun from its sling.

Johnny had been kicked out of the ‘family’ house when Mr. Fantoni’s son had been born. 5 girls and suddenly the lucky prick gets his wife pregnant with a boy, Johnny swore for an hour straight. Mr. Fantoni still needed Johnny though. He was his best guy. Nobody could take care of a problem like Johnny, be it pest control, a simple escort, or something a little more in depth. One day as he was sulking in some shit hole bar, Jane walked in. She walked like she had just thought of something really beautiful the entire way to the bar, and it was also kind of dirty. Johnny immediately bought her and her friend a drink. The friend was harsh at first but Johnny knew how to wear the friends down: The Juke box. Throw a couple of shitty 90s songs and some of the current pop hits and girls can’t help but fucking dance. As Jane’s friend danced with a rotating wheel of guys, Johnny got to know Jane. She wanted to help people. She loved to love and help, she was starting a charity to help starving kids. She had lost her virginity when she was 16. She wasn’t afraid to die. She had had a little brother who died from cancer. She was 5, he was 2. Johnny needed her. More than air, he needed her. He told her right there that no matter what, he would do whatever it took to have her love. That night he was snuck into the house.

Johnny put the shotgun up against his puppet’s back, and blew a hole through him. The guards started firing at Johnny, or the guard really, but Johnny had already shoved his shotgun into his guards entrails, he pumped the shotgun, turned his guard (who was screaming in agony.) to the left and shot the anally fixated guard in the chest, pumped again, and was about to fire at the other guard but his guard’s head was blown off. The blood and bone and brain splattered on Johnny’s face. Distracting him, his shotgun misfired and he quickly shoved his lifeless bulletguard forward and dived to his right down the staircase. Johnny grabbed onto the handrail to keep himself from tumbling all the way down the steps. And braced himself with his handgun drawn and aimed. But the guard wasn’t coming. Either Johnny had nailed him, or he was waiting Johnny out. By now the police would be here any minute.

Johnny stepped up off the stairs and onto the handrail, slowly crawling up it, he got to the hallway entrance and waited. He reached into his back pocket and pulled out a light and a cigarette. He lit it and inhaled. Blowing the smoke forward. Generally only an idiot would fall for this, but the guard was disorientated and hopefully not thinking straight.

“Fat chance psychopath” the guard called out. “If you think I’m gonna fall for scrub shit you might as well just step out and let me shoot you in the face right now.” “So how do you want to settle this?” Johnny answered. “Well I’m just gonna wait here until either A. The police come, B. Your stupid ass steps around the corner and I get to shoot you, preferably someplace painful, or C. You can sneak out of here and pray we don’t find you you cowardly mother fucker.” Johnny only had one chance. He was going to have to just go ape shit on this guy, and pray that he didn’t kill Jane or a family member other than

her father. Johnny rolled onto the hallway firing as he rolled in a circle. He hit the guard once in the shoulder and once in the knee. Johnny quickly ran over and grabbed the gun away from the guard. Johnny checked how many rounds were in the clip liked what he saw, and holstered his own gun in the meantime. “You hear that mother fucker, the cops are” POP! Went Johnny’s gun as he silenced the guard. Fucker was right though, Johnny heard the sirens whining like a fucking baby.

The day after Johnny’s 25th birthday Mr. Fantoni had stopped by the house. Johnny’s dad was at work thankfully, but his mother was quite surprised when she met him. He was wearing a $3,000 suit, Johnny didn’t know the brand, he just knew he had seen the prick yelling about how expensive his suit was after his youngest daughter spilled his coffee on it. Fantoni was a semi-regular guest on the front page of the paper so Johnny’s mom just about shit herself when she opened the door. “Good day ma’am, I’m sorry to bother you at such an early hour but might I have a word with your son?” “J-Johnny? Alright… hold on a minute.” Johnny was slurping down some lukewarm coffee and eating a bagel but could hear the conversation from the kitchen. He got up and came to the door “It’s okay mom, I’ll talk to him outside” “If you don’t mind I’d actually like to come in, It’s very cold out here and I have my son Joey with me” prick Johnny seethed in his mind. The little turd was standing shyly behind his father. Johnny’s mother quickly ushered them in to the den. “Coffee Mr. Fantoni? And how about your son? Would you like some juice sweety?” “Thank you so much but no, we’re only here for just a minute to talk to your son.” “I’ll give you some privacy then.” Fantoni plopped down on the couch in a way that reminded Johnny of the shit he took this morning. Joey was sitting on his lap looking down at the floor. “Long time Johnny, why don’t you have a seat, this won’t take long.” Johnny stared down Fantoni for a minute, contemplating the audacity of being invited to sit down in his own fucking home. But that’s the kind of man Fantoni was, commanding and demanding. Johnny had an idea what the scumbag was here for, so why not take a load off, in spite of this asshole trying to tell him what to do.

Johnny bashed the door knob off with his shotgun, but the door was deadbolted, holding it in place. A shot rung out and passed through the door directly into Johnny’s stomach. Johnny laughed through the pain. This bullet was the period at the end of a very obvious sentence. Not only would he not be convincing Jane that his snuffing out her father was really the only reasonable thing to do under the circumstances, he wouldn’t be making it out of here alive to take revenge on Fantoni. He had considered kidnapping the asshole’s son and holding him ransom. He would never hurt a kid, but he would walk five thousand miles just to jam a needle into Fantoni’s balls. Johnny had to act fast, operating under the assumption and hope that Jane’s family would be in a panic room, he pulled the lynch pin from the grenade Fantoni had given him for his 23rd birthday and prayed it wasn’t bullshit when he was told it was the real deal. Jonny shoved it through doorknob hole and ran to Jane’s room at the end of the hall, diving shoulder first at the door and busting it in.

Fantoni had made it very clear to Johnny that if he did not shuffle off the senator’s mortal coil prior to the election not only would Fantoni be sure to make Jane’s undoing particularly unpleasant, he would also be sure to bestow the same horrors on Johnny’s family. Johnny walked into the kitchen and his mom was watching the news. There was a

huge blizzard that was supposed to be hitting at midnight. Johnny knew that was the only time he could sneak into Jane’s house. Her father had been the subject of many death threats from a variety of mobsters and had very publicly hired a 20 million dollar security team.

Johnny was slow to get up, his stomach was leaking blood like a sieve. He looked around one last time in Jane’s room, mournful that the scents of smoke and blood masked her beautiful lilac perfume. As he limped back across the hall he found himself feeling excited, even now, after everything he had been through and done, and knowing what had to be done, there was nothing more exciting than the kill. The achievement of hitting the target. As Johnny limped into the senator’s bedroom he saw that the king sized bed was on fire, that the guard who had popped him in the stomach was splattered across the window, shoe’s being held in place by the man’s shins which stood there like a twisted shoe display. Johnny walked up to the steel door that the senator and his family were hiding behind and banged on it. “Alright Mr. Senator! That grenade you just heard go off? I have another one, and I am going to place it right against this door and blow everyone in that room to smithereens unless you come out here right now.” Johnny heard crying inside, probably Jane and or her mother. Johnny heard the police setting up their perimeter outside, slow bastards, they could save him if there weren’t so busy adhering to protocol. “Please, I will come out, just don’t hurt my family.” Johnny heard screaming and begging, and the senator told them that he had made up his mind. Johnny heard the beep of numbers as the senator keyed the code, and the sliding of some sort of mechanism, and the door released, and the senator stepped out, pale as the moon, teary eyed. “Please, just don’t h..” he stared at Johnny in shock, and then a look of disgust crawled across his face. “You?!” “I’m sorry” Johnny didn’t have time to explain and risk the police busting in and stopping him short of his task, he was already feeling so weak. He shot the senator’s brains out and heard the screams from inside the panic room. Jane rushed out and screamed in Johnny’s face and rushed at him flailing her hands and nails across his face scratching him in jagged lines. As she clawed him, Johnny noticed that she was wearing her lilac perfume.

“I’m serious, that’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever smelled” “Seriously? Real lilacs smell way better than this.” “I’m sure they would… if you covered your body with them.” Jane mimed a slap and Johnny played along, snapping his neck to the left as though she’d just laid one on him. They had just seen some shitty romantic comedy; they were all the same in Johnny’s eyes. Guy meets girl, they fall in love. Guy does something to break the girl’s heart and it seems like they can’t be together anymore, and then in a grand gesture of love the guy wins the girl back and they live happily ever after. And were now performing their after movie ritual of pizza bagels and waffles at the diner. “Honestly though, you would take a dude back after he made out with your best friend?” “Well I wouldn’t take you back.” They laughed and the waitress brought Jane her pizza bagel and Johnny his waffles, extra syrup, extra whipped cream. “Honestly, provided you didn’t royally fuck up somehow, all I really need… and I know this is trite as hell, is a nice bouquet of flowers, and all is forgiven.” “Good to know, hold on, just gonna put the local florist in my phone book.” Johnny winked at Jane and she smiled sweetly at him.

Jane was bawling her eyes out next to her father, mascara running down her face. The look of hurt and sorrow in her eyes when she had recognized Johnny was the most viscerally horrible thing he had ever seen. “How could you do this to us… to me?” “I know this will never be alright with you, and I know you will never forgive me, but I did this because I love you Jane… more than anyone I’ve ever known, friend or family, and I know this is no excuse… I did this because I love you. There is a powerful man who ..” Johnny heard the main door burst in downstairs and the swat team shuffling in, he heard yelling downstairs and he did the only thing he could think of to make things right, he put his gun into his mouth and as Jane screamed for him to stop, he gave her a bouquet of roses.
