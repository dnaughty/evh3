<h1>Fly In The Soup</h1>

	The fornicating flies were copulating on the rim of the bowl, meanwhile, Susan stared over the bowl looking down at them, her disgust and her curiosity colored her countenance equally so that her eye brows alternated between arching and furrowing. In its passion, the female slipped and started to fall into the soup, her ovipositor dragging her lover along as well. The flies struggled to disengage, but were stuck together. Their movements of thrusting and attempting to pull and wriggle free propelled them forward like some sort of grotesque motor boat. Towards the middle of the ocean of soup the abhorrent insectoid fuckboat collided with a potato wedge. The female attempted to climb up the potato, however, still stuck inside her partner, and while he attempted to pull backwards, her legs slid down and pulled the potato backwards onto both of them, submerging them on a one way course to Davey Jones’ soup locker. Susan frowned. She placed the soup on the serving tray and walked out from the kitchen into the restaurant proper. She walked the soup over to the food critics table and in a fluid motion had the soup in front of The cranky old man. Susan was looking forward to quitting today. She felt bad for the flies, however, it would expedite the process. And hell, at least they died having a good time. Susan had worked at the restaurant for two years now, and she had been sleeping with the owner (on and off) for a year. She knew his reputation, but one night she had gotten drunk with him and the sex had actually made his asshole personality worth it for a while. He was a total dick to her at all times unless they were alone, and even then his banal personality couldn’t muster up more than the most trite and obvious compliments and romantic gestures. Which were such clear and uninspired attempts at getting into her pants that she rarely even felt good about it once the act was finally finished. Alas, there were no longer any perks for her now that Ray had hired a new girl who he obviously was trying to bed.

Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Alex and Jeurys were trying to throw whatever heavy cookware they could at a rat that was scuttling across the floor, Alex found himself feeling impressed with the rat, and thought to himself he wouldn’t feel too badly if it got away. Allanso the chef yelled at them, in Spanish, to quit pussyfooting around and either kill the fucker or he would do it himself. Jeurys, with the concentration of a professional pitcher took a meat tenderizer and flung it towards the rat, at the same time Alex had tried to throw a metal spatula near the rat to scare it toward the door, but that effectively was the rats undoing, because it leaped to the right of the spatula directly into path of the meat tenderizer and it exploded upon impact, bones and blood spraying all over the wall. Alex screamed and Allanso laughed. “Nice job boys, now clean that shit up and get it the fuck out of the kitchen.” Jeurys looked at Alex and scoffed “You look pale bro, never pulverized your meat before?” Alejandro shoved past Jeurys who was laughing now and ran to the bathroom, he was going to be sick.

Matt was pissed. Ray hadn’t shown up or even called or texted since before they closed for the holiday, leaving Matt to do all the prep work for one of their busiest weeks of the year, as well as that old fucking critic emailing them that he would be coming some time this week. The fact that he was able to get everything done shorthanded was a belated Christmas miracle. Being an underpaid manager had been quite a drain for the two years since he had taken on the position, after the female asshole Ray previously had as manager got tired of slobbing on Ray’s knob, Ray got rid of her post haste, and asked Matt, his best friend since high school, who also happened to be down on his luck at the time, if he wanted to come in on the place with him. “No, you’d be doing me a favor” Matt could almost hear Ray laying that bullshit on him again. The last straw for Matt was when Ray started sleeping with Susan, whom Matt quite fancied. He had tried to warn Susan that Ray went through women like Oprah goes through diet plans, but she didn’t listen, and Ray barely even acknowledged the fact that Matt had told him about his feelings for Susan after it had all gone down. And now Ray was on to his next girl, Kim, who was very freshly eighteen. She had been working there for all of about two weeks, and was supposed to be behind the bar for the week on account of their regular bartender’s family emergency, but Kim had been a no show all week. Just another piece of the shit pie Matt had to swallow tonight. And like some sort of joke, right as Matt thought about shit, a fly landed on his nose.

Linda was trying not to cry, Matt had gone out of his way to cover her shifts throughout the week but tonight was too busy and too important. Here she was, serving meaningless drinks to meaningless people while her husband lay quickly dying in the hospice. He had encouraged her to come in to work “The kids will need the money toward their college” he had insisted “And you need to spend some time away from this depressing place”, but that didn’t assuage the guilt, or dampen the pain, and on top of the real shit, there were flies having a fucking mardi gras all over her bottles, at least twenty, plus another forty or so fruit flies, and she could have sworn she saw a cockroach or two as well. “What the fuck is going on here” she whispered to herself, while shaking two martinis. She shook the shakers at the flies and they temporarily evacuated their party. Luckily the only guy at the bar was already piss drunk and half passing out while texting on his phone. She poured both drinks, placed one in front of the patron, and placed the other on the drink tray for Susan. Susan looked even more peaked than Linda felt. “You okay Suzie?” Susan didn’t answer, but Linda thought she heard her say something about “him” not noticing….

Alex had just finished puking up his lunch and was washing his face in the bathroom sink, when a guest walked past him opened a stall door and let out a yelp. “Jesus fucking Christ that’s disgusting!” The man walked over to Alex “Excuse me, do you work here?” Alex nodded. “Well you better clean up that stall man, it’s gross as fuck!” the man walked out of the bathroom shaking his head mumbling something about the manager. Alex walked over and opened the stall door, and thankfully he had already freed himself of his cookies, because the sight was truly repulsive. Someone had left a floater that had more of a resemblance with an anaconda than a peanut loaf in the toilet, and wriggling around in it were hundreds of maggots, and a swarm of about fifty to sixty flies were circling over it like shit buzzards.

Matt was on his way to the parking lot to meet the lock smith who was here to help him with the door to the wine cellar, which was seemingly unlocking but would not budge, when a portly guy in a blue shirt with a classic porn ‘stache rushed over, “Excuse me, are you the manager?!” Matt looked down at the pin on his button up that read “Manager” then back at the guest and nodded. “I don’t know what kind of shit hole this is, I thought Ray kept a tighter ship, but for gods sake get the damn bathroom cleaned up, it’s fucked!” Fuck sakes Matt thought, another tier to the shit cake. “I’m very sorry about that sir, I understand completely, how can you have a nice night out at a place that’s

practically a pig sty! Please, let me buy you and whoever you’re with your dinners and some drinks.” The guest looked at Matt and nodded, appeased. “Well that’s a start, but you gotta have someone checking the bathrooms regularly! Hell, you may even want to hire a bathroom attendant, just hire some Spanish guy, lord knows they’re plenty cheap.” Matt, being of Latin descent himself, bit his tongue, before he encouraged the guy to drop a yelp one star payload. “Thank you sir, very good idea! I assure you I will look into that, and the bathroom will be dealt with immediately!” The num nuts guest nodded and scuttled off back to his table, where Matt was sure he would be cramming another entree into his gut along with some top shelf liquor. He shook his head and was starting to resume his walk out to the parking lot, when Alex came running over to him. “Matt, Jesus the bathroom is fucked dude, someone left a wretched shit in the toilet, I tried to flush it down but it started overflowing dude! I don’t know how to shut the water off.” This was not a top tier day of Matt’s life.

Susan was clearing the soup from the critics table. “How did you like your soup sir?” “You know, despite how it looked, it was quite delicious, I noticed something crunchy and delicate in it, what was that?” “Oh it’s… well…” Susan leaned in close and spoke conspiratorially “It’s actually fly sir, imported from the Chef’s home country, with delicate spices.” She smiled as the critic’s eyes practically bulged out of his face. “I’ll return presently with your entree sir.” The critic nodded but she noticed he was looking even more pallid than when he first arrived. Susan felt a vibration and wanted to check her cell but hated doing so in view of guests, so she made a B-Line for the bathroom. As she was walking to the ladies room she saw Alex standing in front of the men’s room looking even paler than the critic. She raised an eye brow and entered the Ladies’. She walked into a stall and closed it, pulled out her phone and saw that it was just a spam email. She opened up her text messages and looked at the last one she had received from Ray six days ago. All it said was “Im”. Ray wasn’t particularly verbose but that was some pretty sparse verbiage even for him. Normally it would at least be followed with “Horny” or God forbid maybe he could have said “Sorry.” Susan frowned, flushed the toilet so as not to raise any suspicions, and went over to the faucet to wash her hands.

Matt ran up to Alex with a printed sign that read that the bathroom was out of order, and which was crowned with a piece of tape, he gently slide his finger across the tape onto the door and looked at Alex. “Alright buddy, please just wait here and make sure no one Enters this fucking bathroom.” “Dude, I’ve been out of the kitchen for like ten minutes now. Allanso is probably ready to cut one of my heads off.” Matt smirked “I’ll talk to him bro, just give me a few minutes to get into the cellar, which for some reason our glorious leader decided to put all our tools in along with the expensive wines.” Matt finally got out to the parking lot and immediately lit up a cigarette. He wasn’t sure if he shivered from the raw pleasure derived from the nicotine or from how fucking cold it was, but either way it was worth it. He walked over to the Lock smith’s van and waved at the guy in the drivers seat. The guy frowned and got out of his van, reeking of marijuana. “Dude I’m jealous, smells good.” Matt told the smith, “Yeah well I had to pass the time somehow, you had me waiting for like twenty minutes and I can’t leave the van running, bad for the environment and shit.” “I understand, really sorry man, this is literally the work day from hell.” “Tell me about it.” Matt frowned and extended his hand “I’m Matt.” the tall burly lock smith shook Matt’s hand “Travis… Actually, do you mind if I bum a bogie? It’ll top me off nicely.” Matt reached into his pocket, took out the pack and extradited a cig for his new brother in arms. “Wanna do a trade?” Matt asked, winking.

Linda was getting overrun, between the actual and the metaphorical pests she was at her wits end, and Matt bless his heart hadn’t come to check on her or help her out for at least ten minutes now. She cursed that little tart Kim, wondering if that little brat had any idea the misery she was going

through, what it’s like to be an adult with true problems instead of fucking around with boys too old for you. Linda enjoyed a moment of schadenfreude contemplating Kim’s future as a dried out cranky old housewife who could no longer get her way just by pouting at a man. Suzie ran up to Linda “Hey babe, are you okay? Looks like you could use a weed whacker over here.” Linda smiled through her constrained tears. “God yes, pour us up a couple shots while you’re at it sweetie.” “You got it baby!” Susan noticed the bevy of bugs swarming behind the bar and asked Linda “Hey Lin… what’s goin’ on back here?” “Suz, if I knew I-” “Hey, ladies! I’m waiting for my drinks still, can we save the chit chat for some other time when you’re not swamped? I’ve already had a bad enough time here tonight, I just wanna have a drink or two so I can get out of here and finally feel relaxed!” Some chubster num nuts brayed at Linda. A few guests stared at him, the universal signal to let someone know that they’re rude. He didn’t notice. “Sorry about that hun, your Belvedere martinis are just about shook” she turned and whispered in Linda’s ear, grinning “Watch my back Suz, I’m gonna fart in his glass.”

As Linda and Susan fended off the bar guests and other waiters and waitresses served the yammering hoards occupying the tables of Earhart’s, Matt and his new friend Travis blazed a fat one down in record time, and still ever slowly the water from the toilet flowed out, a slight brown tint to it as it filtered through the mammoth shit pile wedged in the toilet hole, over the bowl and out across the floor. Scattered throughout the water, maggots came out like rice boiling over and they slid down the porcelain toilet and into the lines between the tiles like a water park from hell. Concurrently, a thirteen year old girl by the name of Joyce was washing her hands in the ladies room, she dried her hands, opened the door, and came out into the carpeted bathroom hallway, simultaneously the reeking shit water trickled past the door and Alejandro’s feet. The smell was so instantly repugnant that Alex started gagging and the little girl Joyce puked right there on the spot. Joyce looked at Alex, Alex waved at her to hold on with his left hand while holding back his own rebuttal to Joyce’s statement on the smell with his right, cheeks full, but Joyce paid no heed and ran into the dining room proper and yelled, “Mom, dad! There’s SHIT coming out of the bathroom!” Matt floated back into the restaurant after ascending to a temporary cloud 9, but was at last served the shit cake that had been baking all night, with a nice brown frosting on top.

The following hour had Matt comping every meal in the restaurant, giving out gift cards of ascending values, kicking himself internally for getting high at work, and enduring the general kind of awfulness that normally ends once the holidays come to an end. He had sent home most of the wait staff but Suzie and Linda offered to stay, and Allanso volunteered Alex and Jeurys to clean up the bathroom, while Travis the locksmith used some of the tools he had with him to fix the toilet. “I’m not cleaning out that shit though bro.” he had scoffed to Matt. Matt assured him that he would have to do no such thing. Allonso cooked up some burgers and fries for everyone while Matt, Suzie and Linda cleaned up the entire restaurant. “Matty, you need an exterminator in here ASAP kiddo.” Linda decreed while smashing up as many flies as she could get her hands on. Susan mixed some drinks while starting to feel a tinge of guilt about how she had handled the critic. She didn’t care about Ray or the restaurant so much, but hurting Matt and Linda and the rest of the staff was collateral damage she hadn’t taken into account. “Hey Matt, I didn’t see the food critic leave, did he say anything to you?” Matt shook his head “No, but I heard ol’ porn ‘stache saying in spite of this place being a shit hole, he’s never had a better martini in his life, so Linda there is a feather you can stick in your cap.” Linda and Susan exchanged a glance, and Linda gave her a little wink. Presently Alex, Jeurys and Travis came out of the bathroom, Alex had reached an even paler tone than he had displayed all night, Jeurys and Travis looked sweaty but unconcerned. Allonso brought out the grub, which everyone but Alex partook in, and then Matt poured a shot for everyone, even Alex who was underage. “I wanna thank everyone for putting up with Ray’s bullshit, and my bullshit in particular tonight. Linda I want to thank you especially, I’m sorry I wasn’t around enough tonight to help you out, and if we don’t close down after

tonight, I will not let you guys down like this again, that I promise you.” Susan chimed in “And thanks to Alex for not dying on the job tonight!” Everyone laughed and they clinked their shot glasses together, banged them on the bar and drank them down. “Ready to kick that fuckin’ door down big guy?” Matt queried Travis while clasping his hand on the Locksmiths shoulder. Travis shrugged then nodded, and they were on their way down to the cellar.

While Allanso and Jeurys sat upstairs drinking and bullshitting with Susan and Linda, Travis and Matt descended, with Alex bringing up the rear. The lighting was sparse in the stairwell and Travis flicked on a flashlight he was holding in his left hand while his right carried his toolkit. Matt had noticed that bugs always tended to hang out on these steps but this was another level, armies of ants making lines up and down the stairs and going into the wall into holes they had burrowed. “Damn dude what is UP with your bug situation right now?” “I have no fucking clue man. Honestly, Ray probably drunkenly dropped a bottle of wine last time he was here and didn’t bother to clean it up.” “You’ve got a shitty boss dude.” “Yeah man no shit.” They reached the bottom of the stairwell and the end of the ant trail as well. They were going in a steady two lines, one in, one out, under the heavy oak door. This door was the most extravagant thing in the entire restaurant. Matt recalled arguing with Ray when he was getting the wine cellar done. “Bro, if you want to spend that much fucking money on a room five people will ever look at on the regular, can’t you afford to give me a fuckin’ raise?” Ray shook his head “Man, I’m telling you, we need to get that classy establishment vibe first, then we get the top tier critics, THEN you get the bonuses my brother. But I promise their coming.” Matt noticed that his fists were clenched while he recalled how pissed off he had been about this dumb wine cellar. “So you said the key wasn’t working?” Travis asked “Yeah here.” Matt handed over the key and Travis put it in and turned it, there was a sound signifying the latch had disengaged, Travis turned the knob and it turned as though open, but he could not push the door open. He put both hands on the door and let out a grunt as he tried to use force to get the door open to no avail. Travis gave Matt a look, who shrugged, and then they were both shoving and ramming their shoulders into the door. Alex soon joined in and in a few minutes they were all sweating, the ants had been smashed underfoot, Travis was panting and sweating profusely but the air was much cooler down here so their breath made it seem like they were smoking. Travis looked at the other two “Alright so there is one other option… but I don’t think your boss would like this one.” Matt shrugged “Fuck him.”

Linda was sipping on a martini Susan had made for her, while Jeurys and Allanso argued about the soccer match on TV in Spanish. Susan was pushing the straw in her own drink back and forth, looking dejected. “What’s wrong hun? Please tell me you’re not still bummed about that pudgy asshole who can’t keep his dick in his pants?” “God no it’s not that I just…” Susan explained her plot with the critic and she expressed her chagrin at the whole situation. Linda smirked and nodded. “Hey I understand, revenge can make us short sighted, hell, if Kim were standing in front of me right now I would probably slap that bitch. But I’m sure I’d feel badly about it afterword.” Meanwhile Travis had walked by all of them and out to the parking lot. He took out his one hitter and hit it a couple of times to get his buzz back up to where he wanted it. He opened the back of his truck and grabbed a John Deere chainsaw. In the light of the parking lot the green handle looked extra spooky to him. The first time he used it on a job, the customer joked that he looked like Leatherface but not quite as good looking, and since then he hadn’t felt comfortable being seen walking around with it. As he walked back into Earhart’s some pop bullshit was blasting on the radio, Susan and Linda were dancing to it and Jeurys was bobbing his head along. Jeurys looked up at Travis and called out “Oh shit run it’s the Texas Massacre!” Travis who was holding the chainsaw over his left shoulder, gave Jeurys a look that would silence a playground, and walked back down the stairs.

“That Jeurys guy is kind of a dick bag” Travis proclaimed. “Tell me about it.” Alex concurred. “Alright so here is how it’s gonna go,” Travis handed out goggles to Matt and Alex, and then donned his own, “You two are going to stand halfway up the stairs. Matt, if you could shine the flashlight on the door just for extra visual awareness it would be much appreciated, Alex, if Matt starts to look tired holding that flashlight just tag in and get the job done.” They all laughed, and as Alex and Matt walked up, Travis started pulling on the starter rope. The chainsaw ripped into action and the smell of burning wood quickly wafted up to Travis’s assistants. “Fuck dude this door is thick!” Travis called out. After twenty minutes he had to take a break. The three of them sat at the bottom of the stairs taking turns on Travis’s one hitter.

Linda and Susan were on their second and third drink respectively, and Linda looked like she wanted to ask Susan something. “What is it Lin? You look like a kid who wants to figure out the whole world.” Linda smiled, “Well Suz, I guess I was wondering what the hell reason you have for not giving Matt a chance?” Susan’s eyebrows raised “Well I guess I figured one sordid workplace romance was already toeing the line of respectability.” Linda laughed “Oh please, banging the boss and dating a sweet guy are two very different things, ain’t no one gonna judge you for looking for some fun, and no one ought to judge you for seeking out a little bit of happiness either.” Susan smiled “Thanks for that, it’s nice to hear that even if I don’t feel that way, at least some people don’t think I’m a total piece of shit.” Linda put her hand on Susan’s “No, not completely.” and they smiled and drank their drinks.

Matt had taken over for Travis who’s hands were cramping up, and finally completed the circle they were cutting into the door. He laid the chainsaw on the floor and looked at Travis “Do you wanna do the honors big guy? We are paying you after all, provided we don’t go bankrupt after tonight.” Travis shrugged and walked down to the door. He gave the circle a wallop, and then another and it twisted loose and spun into the darkness of the wine room. Immediately a smell rushed out unlike anything they had ever smelled before. It was like a Thanksgiving dinner that had been left out for a month. Sickly sweet with a finish of rotten meat. Alex immediately ran up the stairs covering his mouth and nose decrying“Fuck this not again!” Matt called up “Dude leave the flashlight!” But Alex had already reached the top and slammed the door closed behind him. The remainder spoke with their hands over their nose and mouth. “What in the living fuck is that SMELL” “I don’t know man, but do you hear that?” Inside the wine room it sounded like hundreds of flies buzzing around. Matt reached into his pocket and turned on the camera light on his cellphone. He shone it through the hole and couldn’t help but gasp, the reason the door couldn’t be opened was due to the wine racks falling over like dominoes, leaving the door no space to open. The light was very limited but the room was swarming with flies, a few rats, endless cockroaches and ants. “Dude do you hear that?” Travis asked, scared, “It sounds like the bugs are fucking talking.” Matt listened closely and then he looked into Travis’ eyes, terrified “Holy shit dude, listen.” Under the cacophony of the infestation they heard it, a high cracking voice calling out through the flies “Helllp me… Help meee.”

Hours passed. It was well into the morning when the police finished questioning everyone. Photographs had been taken and Ray’s body had been promptly whisked off to the morgue. They attempted to question Kim but it had been tough going on account of her being in a living breathing hell for about a week. She screamed out “THEY’RE STILL INSIDE ME” as they lifted her into the ambulance. Linda, sobered by the experience and the time elapsed, offered to drive Alex home, and Susan noticed she couldn’t really tell who was more shook up, Alex who went to high school with her, or Linda who hated her guts. Matt had spent the longest speaking with the police seeing as he was running things, and Travis had gotten out of there and soon as he could. Matt shook hands with the cop who was in charge of things, then waved to Jeurys and Allanso to go home. He forced a grimacing smile to Susan as he lit a cigarette, his eyes bloodshot red. “Can I get one?” He lit hers using the

cherry of his, and handed it over. “What the fuck happened Matty?” “Best they can tell, Ray took Kim down to the wine cellar, they were probably already drunk, he locked the door, they got drunker and then…” He trailed off “You don’t have to protect me, I can hear it.” “Not sure if I can speak it though… Okay so… They started going at it, I guess Ray was behind her, and she was holding on to one of the wine racks, and things got heated and she pulled it backwards onto both of them.They sort of wedged between the one in front of Kim and the one behind Ray, Ray’s back broke and he died instantly, She was unconscious for hours, broken right leg and left shoulder. All the spilled wine brought all the pests down there… they started… eating there way through Ray… and she was also covered in wine and so they started crawling places…” Susan sensing his discomfort chimed in “Well that explains our bug problem…” Matt nodded. “So the next day she managed to reach into Ray’s pocket and type part of a message and send it, without looking at the screen, so that explains the text you got from Ray.” Susan nodded. “They laid eggs in her Suzie, for Christ’s sake her life is over! How do you come back from that? How do we? I needed this job…” Susan looked into Matt’s eyes and began welling up, her brows moved together in a furrow, almost like they were trying to console each other with a hug. Her lower lip quivered as she attempted to contain the deluge, but a tear slithered down her cheek betraying her, and the floodgates opened. Matt hugged her and as her shoulders heaved with her sobbing, Matt looked up into the dark early morning sky, clear as any he’d seen in a year, and a shooting star tore past, brilliant and blue, and Matt smiled. “That could have been me Matty” Susan wiped her face and Matt handed her a tissue he took out from his jacket. “I was dumb enough to get tangled up with an asshole that shit like that happens to. I mean Christ how stupid am I? I was banging a guy who’s gonna get a Darwin award.” “Hey but you ended it with him.” “No, he ended it with me. Had Kim not come along, I would have been the one with a lifetime supply of nightmare fuel and therapy bills. And at the same time I actually feel guilty” Matt took Susan by the shoulders “I want you to listen to me, you’re smart, you care about other people, there is no way you’d be dumb enough to end up in a situation like that, so stop feeling sorry for yourself and accept the fact that you’re not a bad person.” “Thanks Matt. You’re a good..” She was going to say ‘friend’ but hesitated, and instead said “You’re a good man.” And now Susan hugged Matt. And as the Sun began to raise just at the very edge of eternity, orange beams glinting, Susan looked up into the remaining starry section of the Morning sky, and just then a shooting star rent through the sky with a blue tail brighter and longer than any she had seen before. And neither of them knew it, but they both were smiling in each others embrace.
